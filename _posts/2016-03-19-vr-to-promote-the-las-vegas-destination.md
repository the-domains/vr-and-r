VR TO PROMOTE THE LAS VEGAS DESTINATION

Some of the best use of 360 photo/video or VR content is in the tourism and hospitality industries. Qantas, Marriott and others have been successfully promoting some of the world's most popular destinations with 360 videos.
Not only can VR promote a location (which is impressive on its own), but it can also let viewers experience the adventure of traveling to a destination. A 360 video can include shots from the cockpit during flight and landing, a passenger experience, a live event or any kind of exciting first-person experience.
Las Vegas as a destination offers it all: 

• Amazing restaurants and famous chefs from around the world   
• Rides (ziplines, Nascar, helicopter tours over the Grand Canyon, ...)   
• Mind blowing accommodations (Hotels, luxury suites, breathtaking views, ...)   
• Pools and spas
• Clubs and superstar DJs
No need for a costly investment to use this technology. 

360 videos are rapidly becoming popular among advertisers as well as travel bloggers and YouTubers, who often have limited budgets and technical resources. Many times, viewers put more trust in their opinions, as they feel a personal connection.
