  Virtual Reality (VR), which can be referred to as immersive multimedia,
  replicates an environment that simulates physical presence in places in the
  real world or imagined worlds and lets the user interact in that world. Virtual
  reality artificially creates sensory experiences.

  Most up to date virtual reality environments are displayed either on a computer
  screen or with special stereoscopic displays, and some simulations include
  additional sensory information and focus on real sound through speakers or
  headphones targeted towards VR users.
